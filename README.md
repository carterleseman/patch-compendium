# Cale's Patch Compendium
Because I can't stand the Nexus Mods editor.

## [AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654)
- [Balthazars Books](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53663?tab=description)

## [Become A Whiterun Guard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36247)
I may not even use the become a guard functionality, but Luka has an enjoyable presence. If you like the diversity he brings to the guard, you may also like [Whiterun Battle Brothers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36036).
Supported Armor Mods:
- [Guards Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671)
- [Sons of Skyrim 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68656)
- [Lollygaggin' - Vanilla Guard Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117833)

Credit to [Teabag86](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Teabag86?gameId=1704) for creating Luka.

## [Blood and Silver - Cidhna Mine Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20269) - Vanilla Hair
Restores the new NPCs' vanilla hair from the 1.2 basic version.

Credit to nerdofprey for creating the expansion, and permitting me to upload this.

## [Caryalind Thallery - Delayed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60911?tab=description)
Level Requirement: **10**
Caryalind's note is delayed until the player is level 10 and has completed Missing in Action or Diplomatic Immunity, with the level being customizable through console commands.

Level requirement can be changed by using the following console command:
```
set SOT_DelayedStart_LevelReq to X
X is the level req. Default is 10.
```

Credits to the commenters on the Caryalind page for the inspiration, the [creator of SOT](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/SidekicksOfTamriel?gameId=1704) for allowing me to upload this, and [AndrealphusVIII](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/AndrealphusVIII?gameId=1704) for basically reworking the entire thing when I was struggling.

## [The DoubtSuspended Quest Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4929) - Myrwatch Patch
*MAY REQUIRE A NEW SAVE*

Made at someone's request. I do not use the Myrwatch creation. Moves the conflicting DB Quest Pack location slightly South. I also fixed a deleted navmesh by reverting it back to the vanilla one and deleting the two custom ones that replaced it. Don't worry about deleted navmeshes in this patch. A picture of the new location for the cave is provided on the Nexus page.

## Draconic Legion Fixed
When searching for an armor replacer for the Imperial Legion I came across [The Draconic Legion - A New Era](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42144), but it had some bugs and probably still does. I'm no longer using this replacer, so if there happens to be any other bugs, I will not be fixing them. The fixes I've made include NPC black face issues, a disappearing imperial sword, and missing hands with certain gauntlets. These also include fixes from USSEP.

## [Faithful Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114342) Consistency Patches
- [Become A Whiterun Guard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36247)

- [Better Courier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40709)

- [Skyrim Silver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127897)

## Hidden Map Markers
Very simple patches to make the map markers in these mods not visible (completely hidden on the map) until you find the location.
- [The Stone of Snow-Throat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21250)
- [The Temple of Black Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23362)
- [The Secret of Dragonhead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23360)
- [The city of Bromjunaar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77327)
- [The Middle Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2219)
  - The Midden Expanded Lite

## Irileth in Chitin - SPID
Using SPID, this gives Irileth chitin light armor, and if you have [Kthonia's Unique Weapon Pack - Dragonborn Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15050), a chitin bow and sword as well.

## Kruziik Missing Textures Fix
The [Temple of Kruziik](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47833) by [Archon Entertainment](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ArchonEntertainment?gameId=1704) (ported by [Milo49](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Milo49?gameId=1704)) has a pair of Nordic axes as a reward, but unforunately those axes have missing textures. This mesh replacer fixes that. A screenshot is provided on the Nexus page.

## [Lollygaggin'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117833) - Less Helmets
Reduces the chance of guards wearing helmets by either 25%, 50% or 75%. Works for both Lollygaggin' and Vanilla. Optional to reduce Reach helmets worn by 100%. Pair with a mod that increases the pool of guard faces.

## Mesh Patches
- [Assorted Mesh Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32117?tab=description) - [Improved Dwemer Glass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44553?tab=description)

## [Riverwood Trader Is A Mess](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63631)
- [Silence is Golden](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50581)
- LotD

## [Simple Tolls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83848) - LotD Addon
*This addon is unsupported, as I no longer use Simple Tolls or Legacy of the Dragonborn*

Simple Tools adds entry tolls to the walled cities of Skyrim. If you are the thane of a hold that has tolls implemented, you can bypass that toll. This addon is similar to that, in that if Auryen, the LotD's museuem owner, has given you the safehouse key, there will now be an option to bypass the toll. Think of it as if Auryen has spoken directly to the Jarl and has authorized your free passage.

## Solstheim Lighthouse Interior Fixes
Includes fixes for [Solstheim Lighthouse Interior](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27887) by [pcaviator](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/pcaviator?gameId=1704).
- Fixed DynDOLOD errors, thanks to [thappysnek](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/141773)
- A named interior cell, so the exterior door doesn't read blank
- A previously unused map marker for the lighthouse
